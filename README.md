# route_optimize
Project for MPT Tabo. With more features than "optymalizacja_tras". For example you can set priority to "2" or "1". Which will make waypoint at the end, or the beginning of the route. It was completely written for the client. So if you want to use it. You need to rewrite it. Especially functions interacting with xlsx/xlsm file.
